    <h1>What is Cannabis</h1>
    <h4>
      <pre>
    Cannabis (/ˈkænəbɪs/)[2] is a genus of flowering plants
    in the family Cannabaceae that is widely accepted as
    being indigenous to and originating from the continent
    of Asia.[3][4][5] However, the number of species is
    disputed, with as many as three species being 
    recognized: Cannabis sativa, C. indica, and
    C. ruderalis. Alternatively, C. ruderalis may be included
    within C. sativa, or all three may be treated as 
    subspecies of C. sativa,[1][6][7][8] or C. sativa may be 
    accepted as a single undivided species.[9]
    

    The plant is also known as hemp, although this term is
    usually used to refer only to varieties cultivated for non-drug
    use. Hemp has long been used for fibre, seeds 
    and their oils, leaves for use as vegetables, and juice.
    Industrial hemp textile products are made from 
    cannabis plants selected to produce an abundance of 
    fibre.

    Cannabis also has a long history of being used for
    medicinal purposes, and as a recreational drug known
    by several slang terms, such as marijuana, pot or
    weed. Various cannabis strains have been bred, often 
    selectively to produce high or low levels of 
    tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a cannabinoid and the 
    plant's principal psychoactive constituent. Compounds 
    such as hashish and hash oil are extracted from the 
    plant.[10] More recently, there has been interest in other 
    cannabinoids like cannabidiol (CBD), cannabigerol (CBG), and cannabinol 
    (CBN).
