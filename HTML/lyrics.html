    Ooh

     I, I just woke up from a dream
    Where you and I had to say goodbye
    And I don't know what it all means
    But since I survived, I realized

    Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow
    Nobody's promised tomorrow
    So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night
    Like it's the last night

    If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
    If the party was over and our time on Earth was through
    I'd wanna hold you just for a while and die with a smile
    If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you

    Ooh

    Oh, lost, lost in the words that we scream
    I don't even wanna do this anymore
    'Cause you already know what you mean to me
    And our love's the only war worth fighting for

    Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow
    Nobody's promised tomorrow
    So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night
    Like it's the last night

    If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
    If the party was over and our time on Earth was through
    I'd wanna hold you just for a while and die with a smile
    If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you

    Right next to you
    Next to you
    Right next to you
    Oh-oh, oh

    If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
    If the party was over and our time on Earth was through
    I'd wanna hold you just for a while and die with a smile
    If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
    If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you

    Ooh
    I'd wanna be next to you</pre
